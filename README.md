# Reliance-Stock-Price-Prediction
One of the most challenging tasks is predicting how the stock market will perform. There are so many variables in prediction — physical vs. psychological, rational vs. illogical action, and so on. All of these factors combine to make share prices unpredictable and difficult to anticipate with great accuracy.  Also, the most significant use of Machine Learning in finance is stock market prediction. In this tutorial, we will walk you through a basic Data Science project on Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning with Python.  By the conclusion of this article, you will understand how to forecast stock prices using the Linear Regression model and the Python programming language.  This post will use historical data from a publicly-traded company’s stock prices. We will use a combination of machine learning algorithms to forecast this company’s future stock price, beginning with simple algorithms like linear regression.
